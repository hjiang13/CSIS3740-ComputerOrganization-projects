# CSIS3740-ComputerOrganization-projects
Seven incremental project assignments for CSIS 3740 (Computer Organization).  Includes starter code, rubrics, and a summary PDF.  Projects 1–4 build a single-cycle CPU simulator; Projects 5–7 are advanced extensions.

# CSIS 3740 — Project Assignments

This repository contains **seven incremental projects** for **CSIS 3740: Computer Organization**.  
Projects are aligned with the course schedule. Together they build a simple **TinyRISC CPU simulator**, starting from data representation and Boolean logic, extending to assembly programming, pipelining, and cache design.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hjiang13/CSIS3740-ComputerOrganization-projects.git
   cd CSIS3740-ComputerOrganization-projects
2. Pick a project folder, e.g. Project 1:
   ```bash
   cd project1_data_representation
   make           # build (automatically creates build/ and bin/ directories)
   make run       # run the program
   make test      # run minimal tests (if provided)
   ```

3. Read the assignment brief in `/assignments/ProjectX.md` for tasks, deliverables, and rubric.

## 📝 Submissions
For each project, submit the following to Blackboard:

  - Source code (C++ files, Makefile, etc.)
  - REPORT.md / PDF summarizing your design and answers
  - Test results / output logs

Projects 1–4 are required and form the core CPU simulator.

Projects 5–7 are advanced extensions (bonus / challenge).

## 📖 Notes
Each project folder already includes starter code and a Makefile.

Do not push build artifacts (bin/, build/ folders) — already ignored by .gitignore.

See the summary PDF for a one-page overview of all projects and rubrics.
